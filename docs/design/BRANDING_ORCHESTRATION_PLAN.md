# Branding Orchestration Plan — vibeforgeai.com

Date: 2025-09-15T09:18:01-03:00
Owner: Branding Orchestrator
Workflow: /branding-orchestrator

## Objectives
- Execute the end-to-end branding pipeline (intake → definition → tokens → visual identity → voice → asset kit → validation/hand-off).
- Ensure artifact traceability in `project-logs/` and documentation in `docs/design/`.
- Enforce Notion Dynamic Root Rule for any Notion automation.

## Scope
- In-scope: Strategy, tokens, visual identity system, content voice, asset exports, governance docs.
- Out-of-scope: Backend integration, unrelated product features.

## Milestones and Deliverables
1. Brand Intake
   - Input: Stakeholder notes, market references
   - Output: `project-logs/product/brand-intake-{timestamp}.md`
   - Acceptance: Problem, ICP, goals, constraints captured; open questions listed.

2. Brand Definition
   - Output: `project-logs/product/brand-vision-{timestamp}.md`
   - Acceptance: Essence, mission/vision, positioning, principles approved.

3. Brand Tokens
   - Output: `project-logs/product/brand-tokens-{timestamp}.md`
   - Acceptance: Color, type, spacing, radii, shadows, motion; AA/AAA contrast matrix; token JSON.

4. Visual Identity
   - Output: `project-logs/product/brand-assets-{timestamp}.md`
   - Acceptance: Logo system, palette application, typography, grid, imagery guidelines.

5. Content Voice
   - Output: `project-logs/product/brand-voice-{timestamp}.md`
   - Acceptance: Voice profile, messaging architecture, examples.

6. Asset Kit
   - Output: `project-logs/product/brand-guidelines-{timestamp}.md`
   - Acceptance: Exported logos/icons/favicons, token files, templates, usage guide.

7. Validation & Handoff
   - Output: `project-logs/product/brand-handoff-{timestamp}.md`
   - Acceptance: All gates passed, change log, final package ready.

## Quality Gates
- Accessibility: Text and UI states meet WCAG AA minimum. Contrast logged at `project-logs/ux/contrast.json`.
- Consistency: No raw hex in components; use Tailwind classes or CSS variables.
- Tokens ↔ Tailwind: Validate mappings in `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/index.css`.
- Versioning: Every output has ISO timestamp and version; update project log index.

## Roles & RACI
- Orchestrator: Accountable
- Brand Strategist: Responsible (Definition, Voice)
- Design Systems: Responsible (Tokens, Tailwind mapping)
- Visual Designer: Responsible (Identity, Assets)
- Reviewer: Consulted
- Dev Integrator: Informed

## Inputs
- Market analysis, competitor references, existing UI constraints, product roadmap.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Token inconsistency → Mitigation: Central token JSON, mapping review.
- Risk: Notion governance breach → Mitigation: Enforce dynamic root script template.

## Execution Flow
- Follow ordered workflows: `/brand-intake` → `/brand-definition` → `/brand-tokens` → `/visual-identity` → `/content-voice` → `/asset-kit` → `/validation-and-handoff`.

## Logging & Artifacts
- Logs under `project-logs/**` with ISO timestamps.
- Documentation under `docs/design/`.
- Public assets under `public/brand/`.
